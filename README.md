# CSC-301-Data-Structures-II

This is the second course in a two-course sequence on data structures using Java. The course focuses mainly on the following data structures, their analysis, and their applications: trees (search trees, balanced search trees), heaps, associative arrays, hash tables, and data structures for representing graphs. The implementation of the basic operations on each data structure are discussed and analyzed in terms of their efficiency. The applications discussed highlight and exploit the unique characteristics of the different data structures, and emphasize problem solving and recursive thinking.
